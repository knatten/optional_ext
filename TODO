Make the `constexpr`s conditional
Consider checking that we actually moved in the functions that are supposed to do so
Better names for the functions
Can we restrict transform_optional to only work on functions that return an optional? Probably, using traits and enable_if or something.
Maybe make `call` conditionally noexcept?
Maybe disable some of the overloads when `T` isn't move/copy constructible
